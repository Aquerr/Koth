## General

### Koth - King of the Hill 

Koth is a plugin targeting SpongeAPI 8.x.x that provides the King of the Hill game mode known from other popular games like Battlefield.

### If you don't know what Koth game mode is

In "King of the Hill" you and your team fight against another team while capturing sectors/flags... so called "Hills".

Captured hills constantly give your team some amount of points. To capture such hill, your team must stand near it and make sure enemy team players are not within its territory as it will stop your capturing.

After hitting a certain amount of points, the game ends and winners get some sort of reward, often in form of items.

## Featues

 - Create KOTH areans
 - Setup custom classes / weapon sets on areans (modded items supported)
 - Place as many hills in an arena as you want
 - ~~Add multiple teams to an arena~~ (not yet implemented) 
 - Setup custom rewards (currently only support items)
 - ~~Economy Support~~ (not yet implemented)
